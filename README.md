# DOM manipulation through JS

## Bianca Stancu

Using JavaScript, we must create a dynamic and resposive website.

## Table of contents

- index.html

- style.css - Main styling and responsive styling

- nav-bar-style.css - Navigation styling

- form-style.css - Form styling

- cards-style.css - Sections styling

- app.js - All of the JS

I have created a website that can be modified dynamically with the help of the data-\* attribute. You are able to create a section in the
html and just by assiging it a data-nav attribute the JS code will create a navigation tag for you and enable you to travel to that section just by clicking the nav tab. You will also be able to see the section that you are at highlited both on the navegation bar and the section itself.
