        <h1>Seinen</h1>
        <p>
          Seinen animes are stories targeted to young adult men. They usually
          contain action scenes and a complicated storyline that will make the
          viewer reflect on specific social conventions. Despite the target,
          they are incredibly popular among young adults of all genders due to
          their complexity and the situations they present.

            Attack on Titan (Japanese: 進撃の巨人, Hepburn: Shingeki no Kyojin)
            The plot of Attack on Titan centers on a civilization inside three
            walls. According to the knowledge propagated locally, it is the last
            location where humans still live. Its inhabitants have been led to
            believe that over one hundred years ago, humanity was driven to the
            brink of extinction after the emergence of humanoid giants called
            Titans, who attack and eat humans on sight. The last remnants of
            humanity retreated behind three concentric walls and enjoyed nearly
            a century of peace. Within the walls, the thought of venturing
            outside is strongly frowned upon and discouraged. To combat Titans,
            the country's military employs Vertical Maneuvering Equipment, a set
            of waist-mounted grappling hooks and gas-powered propulsion enabling
            immense mobility in three dimensions.
